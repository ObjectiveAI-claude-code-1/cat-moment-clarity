This takes two equally valid forms. The first is the frozen miracle: an action caught at its absolute apex, such as a paw frozen mid-swat, a cat suspended at the top of a leap, a tongue caught at the perfect angle of a blep, or the precise instant of contact between a paw and a falling object. These images feel impossible and reveal detail the human eye would normally miss. The second form is eternal stillness: a cat so completely and naturally at rest that the image feels timeless, as though the moment has no beginning or end. In both cases, the moment is captured at the point of maximum intensity and minimum ambiguity. Reject images that feel approximate — taken a beat too early when the action hasn't cohered, or a beat too late when it has begun to dissolve. Also reject images where blur or motion artifacts prevent the moment from fully registering."
