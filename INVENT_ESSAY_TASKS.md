1. Evaluate the emotional readability of the cat in each image. Look at the cat's face, eyes, posture, and body language and determine how instantly and unambiguously they communicate a feeling, action, or state of being. A highly readable image is one where the viewer immediately understands what the cat is experiencing — there is no confusion about whether it is startled or calm, playful or annoyed, mid-yawn or mid-meow. The emotional signal is vivid and unmistakable. Score highest the images where the cat's expression and body tell a single, coherent, loud story that arrives without any interpretive effort. Score lowest the images where the cat's state is ambiguous, muddled, or obscured — where a viewer would have to guess what the cat is feeling or doing. This evaluation concerns only the cat itself, not the setting or composition, and it applies equally to dramatic expressions and quiet stillness, so long as the emotional message is clear.

2. Evaluate the compositional focus of each image — how effectively the framing, background, and visual arrangement direct the viewer's eye to exactly the right place. Look at whether the image has a clear, immediate visual hierarchy that draws attention to the cat and to the specific detail of the cat that matters most in that moment. Consider whether the background is clean or cluttered, whether competing visual elements pull the eye away from the subject, and whether the angle and cropping emphasize the key gesture or expression. An image with strong compositional focus makes a confident assertion about what the viewer is meant to see; the eye lands on the point without wandering or searching. An image with weak compositional focus asks the viewer to do interpretive work — to mentally crop, to sort through distractions, to figure out where the point of the image lives. Score highest the images that feel like deliberate, authoritative visual statements, even if that authority was accidental. Score lowest the images that feel like raw, unrefined captures where the subject competes with its surroundings.

3. Evaluate the temporal precision of each image — whether the moment was captured at its exact peak, not a fraction too early or too late. This quality takes two equally valid forms. The first is the frozen miracle: an action caught at its apex, such as a paw frozen mid-swat, a cat suspended at the top of a leap, a tongue caught at the perfect angle of a blep, or the precise instant of contact between a paw and a falling object. These images feel impossible and reveal detail that the human eye would normally miss. The second form is eternal stillness: a cat so completely and naturally at rest that the image feels timeless, as though the moment has no beginning or end. In both cases, the moment is captured at the point of maximum intensity and minimum ambiguity. Score lowest the images that feel approximate — taken a beat too early when the action has not yet cohered, or a beat too late when it has already begun to dissolve. Also score low any image where blur or motion artifacts prevent the moment from fully registering, since blur replaces the clarity of the instant with ambiguity about what actually happened.
